# Java-Microproject
**Project Title**: Pharmacy Database Management System

**Project Description**: This is my microproject that I did as a part of my college work. I made a GUI using Java, and I used MySQL for constructing and storing the database. This is based on a pharmacy database management system. In the GUI part, details such as the name, quantity, and the price of the medicine are entered. The details are cross-checked with the database, whether the medicine is already entered or not. If it is not entered, then the status part in the GUI will display a success message, otherwise unsuccessful. I have given only the "ADD" feature. This feature will add a new medicine with all the details to the database. This will be very useful for the people who have a lot of data and they had to keep a record of it. 

**Requirements**: Ubuntu or Windows, Mysql
